## Motivation

This notebook is implimenting ICA method to resolved a mixing signal to its constituent components. As a geophysicist it can be very intresting practice.

## Usage example

This methodology can be used in seprating different components of a signal. An Example of this is presented in the following paper: http://www.earthdoc.org/publication/publicationdetails/?publication=95000

## Requierments

The libraries used in this note put are:
1. numpy,
2. matplotlib,
3. wave
4. sklearn.decomposition
5. scipy.io


## File structure

There is a data folder used in this study that contains *input* folder requiered to run the code and *output* folder contains the files that will be createed upon running the notebook.
